# MGM_Model_and_Max-cut
This repository implements quantum algorithms to solve the Ghosh-Majumdar spin chain model and the Max-Cut problem using Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD). It also leverages optimizers like SPSA, SLSQP, and Quantum Natural SPSA (QNSPSA).
